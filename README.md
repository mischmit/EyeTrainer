# About
EyeTrainer is an application that should help to repair limits of the field of view that are contracted for example as a symptom of a mild stroke.

This software is _not_ created by any medical stuff and I created it to help my father regain his field of vision.

Use at your own risk and without any guarantees.

# Installation
